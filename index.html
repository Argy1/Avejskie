      <h2>Mercedes Benz CLS</h2>
      <div class="post-meta">The Mercedes-Benz CLS (initially called the CLS-Class) is a series of executive cars produced by Mercedes-Benz from December 2003 to August 2023.

        The original model was a four-door sedan based on the Mercedes E-Class platform, marketed as a four door coupÃ©. An estate (shooting brake) model was later added to the model range with the second generation CLS. All models are available as a high performance AMG variant, although it wasn't until the second generation CLS that 4MATIC all-wheel drive was offered.
        
        The CLS range is positioned between the E-Class and the S-Class within the Mercedes model range, and models tend to be less practical than the E-Class it is based on. It primarily competes with other fastback sedans like the BMW 8 Series Gran Coupe, Porsche Panamera and Audi A7. Production of the CLS ended on 31 August 2023 to prepare for the launch of the new Mercedes-Benz E-Class (W214).</div><p>
